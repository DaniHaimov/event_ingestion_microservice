# Event Ingestion Microservice

## Introduction
This app provides a simple REST API for creating, reading, updating, and deleting events. 
It integrates with RabbitMQ as a message broker to handle event-driven operations 
and includes CRUD operations interacting with a PostgreSQL database.

## Features
- **Event CRUD REST API**
- **Docker Integration**: Designed to run within a Docker container for easy deployment.

Before installation, ensure that Docker and Python are installed on your system.
1. Clone the repository or download the application files.
2. [Install](https://github.com/DaniHaimov/alerts_notifications_microservice) `alerts_notifications_microservice`
3. [Deploy PostgreSQL](#Deploy_PostgreSQL)
4. [Deploy RabbitMQ](#Deploy_RabbitMQ) (Should be deployed by the `alerts_notifications_microservice`)

## Dependencies
This application requires the following Python packages:
* Flask
* pika
* psycopg2-binary
* dotenv
* Waitress (for production server)

Install dependencies using `pip`:
```bash

```
<a name="Deploy_PostgreSQL"></a>
## Deploy PostgreSQL
### Local Deploy
```bash
  // Refresh the apt-get repository
  sudo apt-get update
  // Install PostgreSQL
  sudo apt-get install postgresql postgresql-contrib
  // Start the service
  sudo service postgresql start
```
  
### Container Deploy
```bash
docker pull postgres
docker run --name postgres_name -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres_pass -d postgres
```
This creates a container named `some-postgres` and assigns important environment variables before running everything in the background. Postgres requires a password to function properly, which is why thatâ€™s included.
